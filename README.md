HNGX MOBILE CV APPLICATION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION This is a mobile application using expo, serving as a comprehensive CV, showcasing personal and professional details. It views and edits the provided CV information. 
The challenge: Figuring how the edit information would reflect on the homepage, so i had to take a short course on contextAPI and used it, and that did the trick.
